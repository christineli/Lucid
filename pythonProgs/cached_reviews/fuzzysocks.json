I wear a 10.5 shoe and 8-12 or 9-11 sock. These fit my feet well. The elastic at the top of the sock is ever so slightly too tight but this will increase longevity. The grips on the sole work impeccably and I do not notice them otherwise which is great. I have two issues: 1) As far as fuzzy socks go, these are medium-high on the shedding fuzzies everywhere scale. 2) The seam at the toe is thick and I feel it atop my toes and this is the only uncomfortable thing about these socks.", "LOVE THEM!", "Work well for elderly mother to provide warmth.

Very comfortable and a great colors", "I was skeptical about buying these socks because I was concerned they might be thin, but they are not.  They are a perfect weight - not too thick and not too thin, J-U-S-T right.  The grippers on the bottom work well and I can't feel them through the socks even on hard tile.  They keep my feet warm and are great for wearing in bed.  I highly recommend these socks.  In fact, I am ordering more of them today.", "for the price, these are great. not as thick as some slipper socks, but adequate. Bought the darker colors because they don't show the dirt (I know it's there, just can't see it)  ;)", "I wear a size 7 1/2 to 8 shoe and I am finding that these run large and twist on the foot making it dangerous when walking on a tile floor.

Not very warm , non slip pads. Uncomfortable to walk on,  just not a good product...", "This are really nice fuzzy socks that have grippers on the bottom to keep you from slipping. Having hard wood floors these are great to wear in the fall/winter! They are amazingly soft! They have held up well through washings. I wear a size 10 shoe and they fit me fine. They are the perfect thickness that I can wear them with my boots too. I will be buying some more as Christmas gifts. They are a very good deal.", "Perfect, cozy warm. Gave to my mother in a rehab center and she said &#34;toasty&#34; when I asked how she liked them.", "I am not wild about these slipper socks.  They are a bit too big for my size 7-1/2 feet, the weave is kind of loose making them seem less warm and cozy than I had hoped for, and I can feel the little plastic things on the bottom of the sock when I walk in them - and not in a good way.  I will either return them or see if they suit other feet in my family.", "the anti skid is a real plus especially for older people  like myself...\nWas extremely happy with the socks  sooo comfortable and warm ....ordered 3 more pair so am hoping these all get me through the winter!", "Very pleased", "nice", "attractive and well made", "One pair the blue one only had the none slip bottom on one sock.

The perfect slipper sock for chilly autumn mornings.", "Love them plan on ordering more", "Just the right size, nice and soft, like the little grips on the bottom.", "The fit is perfect and the colors are just as they appear online, but I am a little disappointed in the thickness. If you're not looking for warmth, as in a replacement for slippers in the winter, these won't fit the bill. They're a little thin in that respect. They wash well, no shedding.", "Works great", "Super soft. Great anti-slip traction.", "Love these ! These are exactly what I had been looking for. They are soft, warm and the non-skid soles are great.

Got to sets: one for me, the other for my Grand-daughter, and she loves purple, so it's a win win.  Thanks", "My only problem with these socks is actually in the photo of the product.  With the exception of the black, the colors are not true. The worst is what appears to be yellow and is actually a very putrid looking sort of faded yellowish pea green. Since I'm only wearing them at home it's ok but I certainly wouldn't want to pack them for a trip with other people... Not the pea colored ones anyway. Color aside, I like them. They are very soft and warm  and the tiny little non-slip flowerets work well. 5 stars for the product. 2 for the colors.", "I bought these to put in my hospital bag when I was pregnant with my daughter. They were super warm and cozy and a year later I'm continuing to use and enjoy them. The anti-skid leaves a bit to be desired - they look like six tiny pieces of cat food and are not very grippy, but I don't have hardwood floors so it hasn't been a big issue. If you have larger calves these might be constricting, as the elastic on the top seems flexible only to a point.\nMy tip: Don't wash these with anything scratchy or light colored that might pick up lint, as they do shed a little at the beginning. Now they're broken in and great.", "Absolutely love these socks- they hold well after repeated use and are really comfy/warm. I wear them around the house because my feet get cold easily.", "I love these, so warm and cozy.", "These socks are the softest, cuddliest, most soothing socks I have ever put on my feet.  The anti-skid features on the sole make these socks ideal to wear with clogs.  My feet are snug, warm even on the coldest days!  I want to buy these for all my daughters!!!", "My fiance loves these.

Loved them.", "the socks wore out with one wear. got huge holes in the heels. They are very warm and comfortable though", "Love these socks!", "I am always looking for comfortable sleepwear socks and the Noble Mount socks are slightly better than most  I have found. when you put them on your feet it feels oh so comfy but then after a little while the elastic top of the sock starts to cut into my legs. The anti skid design on the bottom of the sock hurts  my feet if I stand too long. All in all I would recommend these socks to comfort lovers.", "Item arrived as described and they are so soft and fluffy!  I love them!  The non skid bottom is perfect for walking on wood floors.", "Really like them!", "Wife loves them!", "Very cozy. Happy with purchase.", "I bought these for my mother, who is in a care home. Her balance is bad and she has frequent falls so I wanted a sock that was soft and comfy, like the ones I was having to take away from her, but with non-skid grippers on the soles. She loves these because they're so colorful and expressive, and I love them because they're helping to keep her safe.", "soles too thin", "Very cozy and soft I will definitely be buying more", "wife loved them! would buy again.", "perfect - no complaints", "Not quite as the Karen Nueberg version but good for the price", "I bought these as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend and she loved them so much she ordered another pack! She wore them around the house all winter. They seem to hold up very well through laundering and they are very inexpensive.", "True to size, the little non skid bumps do not bother me at all.", "These were a gift to a 96 year old aunt who loves them!!", "Cushy and wash well.", "This was a Christmas gift for a friend.  She loved them and i would recommend and order again.  I would love to order for myself next time.", "Ok so, these were bought for my girlfriend, but I'm pretty secure in my own masculinity. That said, let me tell you how freakin comfy these things are. Holy COW are these things fun to wear. Especially in the winter time. I've worn a pair of the cheap Old Navy ones, and these are just so much better. The quality is totally worth the money and you'll be THANKING me when your feet are in absolute heaven ever time you put these on.", "Love them! They're soft and warm and are anti skid.", "So Beautiful", "These socks are adorable and mix and match well -- can everybody find the odd matching sock whenever you want? Very soft material but washes well and stays up, about mid-ankle. I'd buy again.", "great gifts for grandchildren", "These sleep socks are wonderful, so warm and feel so good.  They stay on without heavy duty elastic so they're comfortable.  They wash wonderfully, without shrinking.  They have some anti slip stuff on the bottom which stays on nicely through the wash.  The anti slip stuff isn't rigid or hard so there are no rough edges to wake you.", "nice product", "Nice quality. Color is brighter then the pics.", "Purchased these for a gift.  The &#34;stars&#34; are actually snowflakes, and the designs were not as pictured, but they worked for what I needed them for, although holiday cheer in the middle of summer for someone entering the hospital wasn't quite what I had in mind.", "I have only worn one of the three pairs so far, but I expect the other two will be the same. The one I have worn fits perfectly, is very soft and comfy and warm. The anti-skid bottoms keep me from &#34;slippin' and slidin'&#34; when I go from carpet to linoleum. I really like them.", "great", "I got these socks for my mom for Christmas, and she loves them. They're warm, soft and comfy for wearing around the house or in bed when she's cold.", "I bought a set of these for my Mom as one of her Mother's Day gifts.  She is in her late 70s, is always cold (even when it's not), and I worry about her falling - so the anti-skid feature was a major plus.  My Mom absolutely loves them and wears them all the time.  She refers to them as &#34;booties&#34; and not just socks.  They are warm, ample, and comfortable.  A great value and highly recommended.", "Kids and wife love them, surviving being worn incessantly by my kids (regardless of season) very well.", "Great socks, no issues and arrived on time.", "Bought these for my mother n law.  She loves them, they keep her feet warm and she does not have to worry about slipping on tile floors.", "Very soft and comfortable.  Just what my arthritic toes needed. I will definitely order more.", "Love these anti slip socks. Too pretty to call hospital socks. Feathery soft, dressy and very good quality and well made. After the first washing there was a bit of shedding from the inside of the socks but only that once. HANG THESE OUT to dry and fluff on low for a few minutes only. The rubber will burn.", "My significant other found them pretty soft to touch and comfortable to wear. However, there are pieces of fabric  on them that come off the socks. I am not sure if first washing them will resolve this issue.", "Got these for my daughter as a gift.  They are very soft and comfortable.  It was very hard for me not to keep them for myself!", "They are not very comfortable to walk around in, even for a little bit.  I would rather not have the anti-slip option on them.", "Love these socks.  They are very soft, warm, and have anti-skid soles. I wear them every night.", "Excellent no skid socks. Comfortable and beautiful color patterns.  I am enjoying them and have ordered more to add to my collection.", "These are great!  I'm a lady with some big feet, I wear size 11 and these fit me perfectly.  Great quality, very warm and snugly on my always cold feet.", "So so.  Your toenails tend to snag on the inside loops of yarn.  They wash fine, I don't put them in the dryer because of the little plastic non-skit dots.", "My wife likes these but I think they shrink in the wash too much.", "love these socks, they are very soft and comfortable. Feel safe, no slipping!", "Socks are not as big as I hoped for. These are for my mom in law who wears &agrave; size 11 in shoes. Finding socks for her is not easy!\nOther than that , the non skid bottoms are a plus.", "I had purchased these two years ago and they generally lasted until now when I just got rid of the last pair.  This is due to walking a lot on hardwood floors.  I just purchased another 6 pairs and anticipate the same use going forward.", "I got these for a mother's day gift for my grandma and I think she will love them.

What more could I write?", "Fits my girlfriend perfectly.", "Excellent socks. This company that makes these is genius. These socks are so nice that I just reordered a ton of pairs of them including some for myself (mens) pairs. My wife loves these fuzzy socks that are not ones that ball or lint or anything like that.

Highly recommended.", "Fit perfectly and nice and cozy.", "Warm, soft, fuzzy and with skid-resistance, as advertised.  They have an odd plasticky feel, but you get used to that quickly.  If your feet sweat heavily though, you may wish to buy skip these.", "Socks are warm and fuzzy as expected. Slightly better quality then other fuzzy socks. But expect the fuzzy bottoms to start matting almost immediately, as you wear them.\nAfter 2 months of daily use the fuzz hasn't worn off, and the anti skid pads are still in place. But notable fuzzy bottoms have become matted, and DO NOT re fluff when washed.\nThis is what the sock looks like after around 2 months of wear (this is washed & Clean)", "Like these soft and cozy socks", "Christmas gift for my honey and she loves them.", "it's very fluffy and cozy.  The reason i didn't give star was that it shedded alot when i washed it so that my dark clothes ended up with lots of lint from the socks...just happened in the first wash, subseq washes were fine.  i have pretty sensitive feet and the little rubber things on bottom does not bother me at all...", "Good", "Love them!", "Very nice and warm.

Plus, they are soft and fun to wear.", "Very soft and stretchy.  5 on a scale of 1-10 on warmth.", "Cozy  Fit great", "These socks are great!  They are fun, well made, grip well, not too heavy and not to light.  I will be buying more for sure.  Also they do not shed like a lot of my fuzzy socks do.  Highly recommend these.", "Got these for my wife.  she love them!  The material is thick and soft, and there are grips on the bottom so she doesn't slip.", "These are very nice. Really warm, soft, and fuzzy. However, since I have very large feet (size 11 shoe) the anti-skid part is smack in the middle of my foot, where I never put weight. So, occasionally I'll step in a way that it does  &#34;catch&#34; on the floor, and It makes me think I stepped in something sticky since I'm not used to the anti-skid spots. I'm sure for women with smaller feet this isn't a problem.", "My daughter-in-law loves to put the socks on when she gets home from work.  They keep her feet warm and not slick on the hardwood floors.

Only wish they had more color choices.", "Bought for girlfriend. She loves them.", "They only reason I didn't give 5 stars:  the elastic at the top is tight enough that it leaves a deep indentation on my ankle.

I have large feet (runs in the family): women's size 11W -- and these stretch to fit reasonably well, although if my feet were any larger, I don't think they'd be that comfortable.  But they do the job nicely.  The silicone non-skid \"bumps\" on the bottom are a little thicker than I normally like -- I can feel them through the sock -- but it's not overly annoying.\nThe socks themselves are reasonably well made, VERY soft, and so far are holding up nicely.  I've had my 3-pair pack since early Dec 2014, and they're still showing little sign of wear.

We would have sent them back, but her feet were so warm and comfy wearing the remaining two pair, that we decided to keep them. Five stars for the ones we kept, one star for the pair we threw away.

I thought they were going to be plush and warm, but they are quite thin for &#34;fuzzy&#34; socks. They are also smaller than expected- I wear a size 9 1/2 or 10 and these BARELY fit. The anti-slip bottoms are nice, but because the material is so thin, I don't know how long they will hold up for. All in all- probably wouldn't have bought them in a department store because they don't pass the &#34;feel&#34; test, but I'm not returning them... My advice- buy socks in a store.

The choices are endless. The socks are nice and roomy at the ankles and lower leg area, so your legs and ankles will not feel confined. I actually purchased 2 different color sets, because there were so many color varieties that I liked. These are great socks to pad around your house in or wear to bed.", "These are so soft & the grips are not hard like they are on many other brands.

For the past few years I have been having more and more difficulty keeping my feet warm during the winter.

I was somewhat concerned about one review in which the person stated that they were constantly aware of the rubber non-slip pads on the bottom, and that they actually hurt the bottom of her feet when she walked on them, but my wife reports that she does not feel them at all.

I can't feel them at all.", "Very soft and comfortable", "great stocking stuffer for teens", "Like other socks made of this material, these tend to get nearly pulled off every time I walk.  It's nice having the rubber anti-skid buds on the bottom but since they turn and twist every time I move, those really don't do much good most of the time.

I wear a size 7-7.5 in women's shoes, and these socks fit pretty much perfectly. They cover my ankle, which is good. The elastic is enough to keep them in place without digging into me and leaving a mark. One reviewer mentioned the sticky pads on the bottom feel like you're walking on small balls. I don't feel that way, but I can definitely tell there is something on the bottom of the sock when I'm wearing them. It's not uncomfortable, but it is noticeable.

Nice and warm and definitely help me from not slipping around. Great value too!", "Comfy! But sheds quite a lot.", "I purchased these as a stocking stuffer for my wife because she loves having warm cozy feet. Well that' what she got. Too bad my daughter steal them and wear them too. I should have got all my girls, two daughters and my wife, each a set.", "I love these.  Just right for wearing in the evening while watching TV or reading a book.  I wear them to bed also to keep my cold feet warm.  I wear a size 7 and these socks are just right.  If you have larger feet,  they are going to be small.", "very soft  wash them first inside out great to walk on hardwood floor warm and no sliding", "comfortable.great fit", "too big for me", "Thread on the top of socks is coming lose.", "Granted I wear a size 10-11 shoe but these are very small. The heel part just reaches about 3/4 up my foot. With that said, they are not really &#34;fitted&#34; so it kind of doesn't matter, except the heel grippy things are under my arch and they end up being pretty short on me.  They are super soft though so I'm keeping them anyway, just to wear around the house.  They are maybe a little thinner than I thought they would be too, so not sure how warm they'll be in the dead of winter.", "Bought these for my aunt who is recovering from surgery. They are comfortable, warm, and soft--she loves them. I love the non-stick element--so we are both happy!", "These are great! Feels as if my feet are being hugged! Very soft and cozy! The non-stick bottoms have just the right amount of friction. The elastic is gentle. So far they have held up well in the washer/dryer.\nI used to have to wear 2 pairs of socks, and the outer one would always slide off. But so far this is all I need. They stay on, and and super comfy and warm! I will be buying these again.", "Oh yum,, so fluffy and cozy and warm. I would highly recommend these socks to anyone . If you're thinking about it, go for it, you won't be sorry! My feet get so cold in the winter and these are just perfect, they don't feel constricting at all. A good purchase!", "It's often too difficult to find this quality and fit (wear size 11-12) They fit and I love them.  I'd like to order more. Thank U.", "These socks were a gift for my sister who is diabetic. She loves them. A++", "These slipper socks are both warm and comfortable. I like the anti-skid feature as well. Would buy again (already have).", "A gift for my sweety, one she absolutely loves.  I suspect she'll buy more on her own.  Apparently they are extremely comfy, and the anti-skid grips work on our hard wood floors.", "I love wearing soft socks like this during cold weather. It's only September and I'm already wearing them.  I specifically was looking for some with anti-skid because I was about to have back surgery and wanted to be sure it would be safer walking.  As it turns out, I'm not just happy with the anti-skid, but these are the softest of this type of sock I've had.  I've been buying soft socks for many years and these are very high quality.  I've washed them several times and they are like new.  I'll definitely be going back for more of this brand.", "I found the socks to be perfect...excellent fit, lovely colors  and skid proof.  But too toasty for warm temperatures!", "These socks will be fine as the weather gets colder.  I can feel it in the air, which is why I bought these.  They fit fine, not binding.  Nice design.  Glad there are 3 pair in the pack.", "Helps me feel secure while walking on our hardwood floors", "Was a gift and person wears them so I assume all is well", "Soft and comfortable. I really like them. Non-skid bottoms.", "These socks are my savior.  I love them.  They wash up so nice and are so soft and cozy.  My feet get cold a lot and these are great to take away the chills.  They have the non-slip grip on the bottom which I couldn't do without.  Bright colors.", "They feel apart to easily but comfort", "I like the grippers on the bottom perfect fit for me", "Some of these types of fuzzy socks fray and some don't - but these do, BUT, not as bad as some others I've purchased.  They are comfy and am looking forward to wearing them this winter.  Love the designs and as always they will keep my feet warm.", "I bought these for my wife and she absolutely loves them. In the winter months she wears these all the time around the house. Highly recommended by my wife and worth every penny.", "Cute socks! Great to give as a gift and use for around the house.", "These socks are so comfortable and safe or using on Hardwood floors.  The colors are my favorite and go with most of my lounge wear.  Would order them again.", "washes well and fits well", "Very soft with good grips on the bottom that aren't too big. I wear a size 8.5 shoe in womens and these fit perfectly.", "they look slightly bigger in ad.", "As soon as I got my first order of these socks, I immediately reordered another set. The socks are just what I wanted. I find them very comfortable.", "Bought for my wife, she loves them.", "excellent", "Socks arrived in time and are perfect.  I love them. Will order more when the need arises.  Also will be getting some as a gift for a friend.", "I would recommend these to a friend. Soft and comfy. Nice alternative to hospital socks. Well priced, too. Good grips.", "Socks fit well. Keep feet warm. The socks wash up really great. I do. Air dry them, but I air dry all my socks.  I will definitely reorder these again.", "These were a gift for a family member.  They arrived on time, and they fit just great.  She was pleased with them.", "Socks run small, are not warm though I do like the color choices and patterns offered for these socks..anti skid foot pads are not very effective", "These socks and so soft and comfortable. I wear a size 5 1/2-6 shoe and these are a little to big. It says one size fits all. I'm hoping they shrink when I wash them. Love the colors.", "I wear a size 8.5 shoe and the sole portion only covers about 3/4 of my feet with remainder barely reaching to top of ankle.  The knit is adequately fuzzy but sparse. Two of the pair had holes in toes and heels after only one wearing.  I cannot recommend.", "perfect socks for my wife to wear around our apartment, soft and warm and the little pads on the sole prevent slipping.\nshe planned on giving a pair to our teenage daughter but wound up keeping all three!", "The socks are colorful, soft, fuzzy, and cuddly. They are perfect for wearing around the house in place of slippers.", "I have recently become almost bed ridden and with that comes cold extremities, even in summer.  These are so soft and keep my feet cozy warem.", "fuzzy stuff inside flakes off.....nice 'joke' present for the young ones..should have read prior reviews....oh well! Can lead an old horse to water....don't mean they should drink....", "They are warm, soft, fuzzy, and non-slip. I wear them all the time when at home. I have happy toezies.", "these will be perfect come next winter...I normally run hot so I like lightweight warm clothing for at home in winter...these keep feet and ankles warm without being too hot...plus can wear them without shoes or slippers and not fall over because of the anti-skid doohickies on bottoms...three pairs so can have one or two in the wash and still have cozy feet and ankles...plus lovely combos of blues which go with my nighties and robe...", "I purchased this for my wife to have non-slip socks for walking around the house with wood floors.  Works great, has held up well, and she loves the socks.", "I don't write a whole lot of reviews, negative or positive, and yet I'm the type of person who will read 100 customer reviews prior to purchasing something until I'm sure I know I'm getting a product that I feel good about. I have ordered feet socks from Amazon off and on since 2006. Some were knee-highs, ankle length, and mid- calf length. Some were warm, but had no traction when walking. Some never warmed my feet, but had pretty decent traction. I rely solely on on-line shopping due to illness, so sometimes it's a  \"push comes to shove\" because I need 'warm' socks.\nNever have I found and worn such awesome feet socks with traction. I ordered my first set on April 30, 2014. \nNoble Mount Women's (3 Pairs) Soft Anti-Skid Fuzzy Winter Socks\n. Received them a few days later and immediately put a pair on and fell in love with their warmth, comfort, and traction.  Many of you must know that uncomfortable feeling you get at the toe seam when putting on new feet socks!  In my case, I feel that seam about 90% of the time and hate it. Not in this case, I must say. These socks felt so wonderful.\nI ordered 3 more pairs on May 6, 2014, received them a few days later. They wash and wear fantastically. You pay $5.00 a pair and I think that is more than a fair price. I'm thinking of re-ordering another 3 pairs for back-up.\n**EDITED** I purchased 3 more pairs to make it a total of nine pairs of socks!", "I like to sleep in soft socks, and always walk around the house in them instead of shoes!  All my other socks were too big, or misshapen, so when I saw these i wanted to try them.  GREAT value, 3 cute pairs, wonderful fit, and very soft.  If they get more colors, I'll buy them again!", "Love them! Exactly what I was looking for! Very soft and fuzzy and fit great! Will definitely order them again."]
