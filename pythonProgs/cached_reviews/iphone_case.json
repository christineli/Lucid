First off, it fit the phone perfectly, and was easy to put on and remove, but was snug once it was on.\nThe back plastic part felt a little tacky while handling it, but it wasn't too uncomfortable, and will probably normalize with more usage.\nThe button covers worked just fine, they weren't too bulky.\nThe only thing I can't review yet is the wear.

It is sleek, attractive and has protected her phone well. She has dropped it several times, but nothing crazy.

Whatever heft is added by the case does add a sense of security when handling the phone. It definitely feels like it's relatively well-protected. I also appreciate the larger space to press down on the volume buttons on the side of the phone. Much easier to feel them out without looking at the phone. The angles on the case also help to solve the issue with the phone being pretty slippery without a case on. The only thing I'm not particularly a fan of is the cutout in the back to show off the Apple logo. I had a similar design on a case for an iPod Touch a few years back and that part of the device was scratched up over time. I'm hoping that's not the case with this device and it's &#34;new&#34; higher-grade &#34;aluminium&#34; *read in Jony Ive's voice*, but it still worries me. I don't buy cases to only protect SOME of the phone's exterior.", "Excellent brand I recommend it 100%", "Yup, it's got a hole so you can let people know it's an iPhone.  But I don't really care to show off.  I got a black phone.  I drop it enough times that I want the corners and screen protected.  I used to go with Element Case which has a similar design, but decided to try this since it was similar but less expensive.  I love it!  Already saved my bacon from a corner impact from dropping it a few times now.  Definitely a great case if you don't mind the sleek iPhone shape being bulked up and made a bit more masculine with angular edges.", "It protects my phone.  I have dropped it a few times from tabletop level and no damage to the phone.  No interference with putting the charging cord in the bottom.  Easy access to the mute button. I love the slim design.

Great overall.", "Very good case.", "A great price for a great device, if you're looking for slim and durable then you must get this!", "Love this case!", "It's a good case and very strong.

It took me a bit of time to get used to the fact that the sides of this aren't particularly &#34;sticky&#34; with grippers or something. It was a little slick at first. I think it might be getting a bit worn now and losing some of it's initial new-product slickness. But it still looks fantastic and is protecting my phone very well.

The screen protector I purchased was the &#34;Glass Screen Protector&#34; (no brand name, apparently) using &#34;Mpero glass.&#34; This product has over 8,000 reviews, so I figured it must be pretty good--and it is! Easy to put on and clear and all the other good stuff. But . . . when I then put on the Spigen case the case's edge pushed up on the edge of the screen protector lifting it off of the screen. I tried my darnedest to lift the edges of the case over the screen protector, but to no avail--it's just not going to happen. Perhaps my case is a little different than others, or perhaps other people just don't notice that their glass screen protector is not making full contact with their iPhone's screen, but regardless of the reason I will be sending this one back, and then it's back to the drawing board.", "good", "Item came fast and perfect as expected!

Not so comfortable to hold.", "great product still using it and its been over a year! thx", "Great case. I actually dropped my phone in a parking lot about 20 minutes after I put this case on and no damage!

Every single phone I have ever had I order this case. It perfect", "Better case than I expected.", "good case", "One of my favorite cases, because it's sleek and light.

Provides awesome protection! And is not that heavy. Yes it weighs more then just the phone itself. But that is expected of a case. But still no heavier then my old phone (Samsung S4 Active) Covers the edges nicely so they don't get ruined. I would definitely buy another one!!", "Seems like a sturdy case.

Will last for a long time to come.", "Great case for the money.", "very good", "Honestly the best cell phone case I've ever had.  Fits perfectly.  Looks cute.  Cut outs for buttons and ports are perfect.  Buttons work extremely well after case is on.  What more can you want?", "good", "This is my favorite of the many iPhone 6 cases I have tried. It feels good in my hand, slides easily in and out of my pocket and it isn't slippery.\nI have a glass screen protector on the front but the lip of this case is high enough that I don't really think it's necessary.\nWe have ceramic tile and hardwood floors throughout our house and my phone is dropped multiple times per day, often by my toddler from her high chair onto the tile floor. It hasn't incurred any damage yet!\nI've been using this case for several months and it still looks decent. The silver plate in the middle is a little scratched up but it isn't chipping and under the scratches it is the same silver color so it isn't very noticeable. The rubber has not stretched out at all. I am very happy with this case.", "This was my #1 case for my iphone 6, and I gave it to someone else after heavy use and they still love it.", "I've dropped my iphone a few times and this case protected it just fine.  Also, I haven't had any issues connecting the auxiliary jack and lightning connection with the phone case intact.  The case looks nice and sleek; does not add too much bulkiness to the iphone.\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the power button - you have to firmly press down on it to get a response.  This can be annoying when I'm trying to snooze my phone's alarm clock.", "Case is super strong and does the job of protecting the iPhone. Please Note: Purchase a screen (tempered glass) protector in order to further protect the iPhone screen, do not depend on the case to protect the screen. Other than that, the case is wonderful, heavy duty and light in weight. Even though it adds centimeters to the phone, it is WORTH it for the PROTECTION of the shock proof built into the case. This is my 2nd one because a family member liked it so much they TOOK it from me!", "Bought for my mom for her phone and she loves it!  Slides in and out her pockets with ease. She's 65 and has shattered 5+ screens with her phone getting stuck trying to get it out her pocket! All I've ever bought was Spigen cases for my iPhone's and you won't get a better quality case for the price.", "Makes handling my phone a pleasure", "I really love this case. No matter how many times I put it in my pocket and take it back out it does not slip off of my phone like many other covers do. I have dropped my phone on the street as well as wooden floors and it has not allowed my screen to crack at all. I don't even have a screen protector on at all. The phone just bounces and settle sooner ground without the screen even touching the floor. The color is beautiful as well. I don't really care to use the card if it comes with it to prop it up but that might be because I don't work out of the house. I don't watch movies on it as well so I really don't need it but it's a neat concept to be able to keep a card in your wallet or purse and use it whenever you want instead of having a clip that's attached to the case and it possibly breaking off. I would recommend this case over the silicone cases that are out there because those tend to stretch out eventually. I had about two of those and they became a nuisance and then I need to buy another case. This is not one of those types of cases. People can hear me seamlessly over the phone as well. I can watch YouTube videos without the case blocking the the speakers. Using the power button and volume keys are pretty easy. Many silicone cases force you to push really hard on the buttons just to get the phone on or off but these do not have that problem.", "It's a cool case, I like it alot", "Bought this for my iPhone. I drop my phone more times than I would like to admit, after about a year. My phone is still in near perfect condition. The back is a tad scratched from being in and out of my jeans and purse. But still in amazing condition. I continued to recommend them to everyone I know. My fiancee, mother, brother, and father all have a Spigen tough armor case on their phones too.", "Great case for a great price! Looks great! Not too bulky, very stylish!", "Love this case!  Not the first phone I have purchased this case for!! I find it to be heavy duty, slim, and easy to put on/remove from the phones.", "My son's phone shattered when he dropped it trying to put in his pocket. The company wanted all this proof to reimburse us for the &#34;Tough Armour&#34; case. It's a piece of crap. The name of the case is very deceptive. Wouldn't buy this case ever again. Now I'm stuck paying for a new screen and had to buy a different case too. Life proof or otter box is a much better case.", "As someone with fumble fingers (coupled with the iPhone's propensity to be a bit slippery) this is the perfect case. The case is sturdy but doesn't take away from the sleekness of the phone.", "I researched several &#34;rugged&#34; cases and the Spigen ended up as one of the 5 I decided to purchase and test (at my own cost - these were not discounted or provided).  My criteria was to have a very rugged case that was also somewhat rubberized so that I could firmly hold this while handling, talking, etc.  I didn't care about waterproof and full dust proof - just a solid case to deal with my active lifestyle and generally being rough on a phone.  I tried the i-Blason, Moko Heavy Duty, UAG (Under Armour Gear), Spigen, and the ZeroLemon.  The ZeroLemon was my favorite by far - also the biggest and most &#34;rubberized&#34;.  Second choice was the Spigen.  Ultimately I didn't go with the Spigen because it was too thin and difficult to hold.", "Do not buy! Do not buy! Do not by! Very very poor quality. The case is very cheap feeling plastic and the screen cover does not seal down on the phone leaving air bubbles all over.", "I've been using this case constantly since I bought my iPhone 6 back in February 2015. The case is a little difficult to put on initially, but I've discovered this is because it's intended to stay on to protect your iPhone - which it does. Sometimes, the bottom of the case causes discomfort in my hand/fingers because it's hard and a little sharp, but it's not a major issue. I've received a lot of compliments because of how attractive the case is and how well the color matches the gold of my iPhone; it really is almost identical. I've dropped my phone a few times (from a decent height and onto a multiple surfaces - concrete, wood, carpet, etc.) without any damage. I should mention, however, that I have a glass screen protector. I would advise anyone getting a case to also go ahead and add some extra protection to the screen. Overall, I've been very happy with this purchase and don't intend on buying a different case in the near future.", "THIS IS THE BEST BRAND FOR THE IPHONE!

My order got mixed up with someone else but customer service was awesome and made thing right. I have seen better protective cases but not with access to the phone as well as this one.", "The case and protection are nice no issues but the kickstand for this upgraded model is stupid!\nIt is a card that doesn't stay attached to the phone it is separate and you would have to carry it around in your pocket or purse then attach it to the phone to use it.

After two weeks, it slipped once, off a low table onto carpeted floor, and the glass cracked in three places.

Love the overall design and compactness. Will protect the phone well, except for the screen. Luckily I put tempered glass on my phone because the first two times I dropped my phone with this case on it, the tempered glass cracked in two separate spots. Bad luck or not, that's why I only give this a 4 star rating. Granted, buying a slim case means you sacrifice protection. If you're not too concerned with protection, this is your case.", "Great case for slim pockets!", "Loved it. It feels great in the hand, nice grip. It seems very tough so I am very confident that this will protect my phone.", "After a few months I really love this case for the money. I use to buy spec cases no more.

I get compliments on it all the time.", "Great solid case, takes some effort to get the case off, once it's on, which is a good and bad thing. . . I'll give it 5 stars because it does what it's suppose to do, well. It looks great, protects, and is relatively small/thin for a protective case. I wish I didn't have to pry it off of the phone with a knife (maybe I'm weak?), but I rarely take my case off anyways, all of the ports work fine.", "Absolutely awesome case.

The rubbery part of the case isn't the sticky kind, it's more of a hard plastic rubber. My only complaint was the screen protector never stuck to my screen!

Then when I was looking for a protective case, I found this one- it matched the metal on the phone exactly, only with a little bit of extra rubber to ensure the safety of the phone.

I also really like that the case rises slightly above the screen so if the phone ends up on its face, the screen is still protected from contact with the surface. But does it work? Well...I accidentally dropped my phone from a height of about three feet onto concrete. It landed on a corner and bounced.

The screen cover in the front is a little thicker than I'm used to but works very well and hopefully protects the screen well.", "Good case. Saved my phone already.", "Pretty cool! I had a little trouble with some of the connections but it worked in the end and the screen seems fine. If you are not so handy, as I am, just bring it to the Mac store and have them replace it. Doesn't cost much more to have a professional do it. If you do decide to try to install it yourself, take your tine", "Works well fits nice", "First time my son's iPhone fell and hit the corner, the glass broke.

The ruber(ized) portion is somewhat rigid with hard angles but the reason I'm returning this case is the cutouts on the bottom for the power and headphone ports.  These cutouts actually hurt my fingers that rest there when I hold the phone upright.  If the case wasn't as rigid or the angles more rounded it might not be an issue.

Toting around an Otter Box is like hauling around an engine block from a 1982 Chevrolet, but the thing will survive a meteorite strike. The Spigen case, on the other hand, is slim and form-fitting, retaining a semblance of portability. However, I doubt it's going to take much more than a simple three- or four-foot gravity-fueled excursion. I have monkey-fisted mine a couple of times without damage to the phone, but nothing extraordinary. I have no idea if a clumsy person would like this case.\nI do. It's attractive, gives good access to function switches, and protects the camera lens from surface scratching.

Great quality, and really cool sleek look! I really love the color gold and had to look for a nice looking, sleek, GOOD PROTECTIVE QUALITY, gold case... Which I went through a few and none of them seemed to get the job done. I had to choose between what I thought looked nice and what would protect my phone. But when I received the suggestion of finding a case on Amazon, I laughed assuming I'd still fail at my hunt. As I was looking through cases on Amazon, I did see cases that could fit both descriptions of what I want and needed, but I decided to settle on getting a gold case first then get into colors and designs later. I found this case and thought it looked pretty cool and protective, the reviews were great, and the price was really really cheap! Shipping was also pretty fast. This case has to be the best case I have ever had out of all of my previous cases and phones. And the gold matches my iPhone 6's gold as well!

LOVE THEM!!!  I hate bulky cases I cant fit in my pockets, but these keep the phone thin while still protected.  I have dropped my phone many times and case holds up well.

I returned this one, with a fragile tripod pivot leg: http://amzn.to/1N175tX same brand & color.\nThe layered case allows me to include the necessary metal plates for my magnetic phone-holder, without evident bulge.", "So far so good.  It seems to do all you claimed....of course, I haven't dropped it yet!", "Very nice.", "VERY DURABLE! I drop my phone way too often and this case has held up great for months. I even dropped my phone from the top of some bleachers...it landed on concrete and NO damage!", "This is a great case! I bought it last year and it has held up quite well. The case isn't flush with the screen; it's slightly higher to protect it I presume.

Best phone case I've found for any of my devices.", "I purchased this for my husband, who did not like how bulky his Otterbox was.  He really likes this case.  His phone is secure and there isn't a lot of extra width or weight added.  Our 1.5 and 3 year old routinely look at the photos on his phone and this case has protected it from their havoc.  I would definitely recommend this & purchase it again!", "This case has been so durable. My husband uses it everyday and brings it to work. No scratches or broken pieces on his phone. It works great!", "My wife got me this case for my iPhone6. I really like the construction of it. It fits very nice on the phone and my favorite part is that it does not make the phone bulky at all it adds minimal amount of bulk to the whole package. One of my managers like it and he asked me to get him the same one but in the gun-metal to match his iPhone. And I have dropped my phone a few times and no harm to my phone the case has some blemishes but still looks good", "I agree with other reviews about the &#34;sharp edges&#34;, difficult to remove (which is both good and bad), and possible lack of protection. The rubber casing is not soft and not very ply-able. Impact resistance would be minimal. However, the feel of the case is remarkably sturdy and allows you to grip the phone with little fear the it fall out of your hand. It is not &#34;slippery&#34; to hold as some described, but there are many cases out there that have softer rubberized or silicone exteriors that could make this considered relatively slippery. No where near the native backing of the phone. I think that if fits in my hand comfortably and I can one the phone easily without much fear of dropping it. Since it's not silicone or soft rubber, if slips in and out of pockets easily. I personally think that it's one of the best compromises between got and it's pulling my pants pocket out every time I get my phone. Impact resistance is the biggest question. The hard rubber is that; hard. Much of the impact would probably go to the glass. I think that it will help, but other may be better. There are tiny, really tiny, pockets in each corner that are supposed to allow for flex, but I doubt that they do much, especially since the rubber is to firm. Because the runner is so firm, that is why some call the edges &#34;sharp&#34;. When you first hold, it does feel very awkward since those beveled edges dig (grip) into your hand in odd spots. It makes it more secure in one sense, but you also grip lighter to avoid the feeling of the edges. After a few days my grip adjusted to feel more natural. The case is solid and little heavy feeling. Again, something to which you adjust. It's not too heavy, but I did notice its weight. You can remove the phone, but it's tight fit (which is actually great). It requires you to have the facing you and pry towards you from a corner with all four fingers on the front edge and thumb on the back. It gives the best leverage for removal. Do it to each bottom two corners minding the buttons as you pry it the rest of the way off. Once the bottom is free the rest comes off quickly except for around the buttons; just takes the typical finagling. Buttons are firm to push. Again, the hard rubber buttons over the normal buttons are firm, making the button pushes firm. I like that because it prevents accidental pushing. However, you do need to have at least on finger the other side of the phone to push the button as counter force. The mute button is tucked away in it's own recess making it manually movable but should never accidentally set to mute; this always happened in older IPhone cases that were soft silicone or rubber. All the cutouts are spot on.\nOverall, I've grown to like this case a lot. It seems to provide some (I'd say good) protection, is easy to pull in and out of things like pockets, is secure in my hand while working it (even one handed), and give the phone a more slid feel with it's excellent fit. I even like the look. Price was also reasonable for the quality of the item and fit.", "I used this phone case until I purchased a different grand, but I loved it!

I personally like it. What I would say is not so great is the ability to stand as represented in the pictures. Using a card is not as effective as it seems.

I was not happy about her having a $750 phone when she couldn't even be trusted to take care of the cheaper ones she had had before. I decided a quality case with protection for the screen was a must. Our entire house except for the bedrooms is marble tile. We need cases that can take heavy impact. This one looks like it can do the job, except for the front. The screen protection is your standard screen protector. It's not heavy duty and it's not tempered glass or anything so it won't protect the screen from impacts.

This is the first phone case I bought for my iPhone6 when they came out and I've always kept it on (with a screen protector!!). It's a little rough around the edges of the case but it smoothens out ans you get used to it. The iPhone 6 has always been too skinny for my hands anyway.\nI have dropped my phone countless times  from my SUV car seat down to rough parking lots, while skateboarding, and even forcefully thrown against drywall out of anger, + much more. Not once did I ever recieve damage to my phone while using this case.

The only thing that I noticed since putting it on my phone, is that I now have microphone issues when on a phone call.", "I've had a few Spigen products by now, which makes me comfortable with knowing what to expect from the brand. Prior to this case, I was using a Spigen Air Cushion case. This case is definitely thicker and heavier but offers more protection and seems similarly durable (the Air Cushion case shows no signs of failure after 10 months of use). It is comprised of two parts that mate together well without adhesive (they hook together along the edge of the plastic). The angular nature of the case caused some edges to feel a bit sharp at first, but they're fine now that it's had a week of wear in a pocket.\nI agree with other reviewers about the gunmetal color; it is not a neutral metallic grey to match the grey iPhone as some might assume. It has a warmer tone to it. However, it is still a nice color that doesn't look cheap.\nAnother case to consider is the Spigen Tough Armor S case which seems the same but has a slot to allow a credit card to act as a kickstand, or the Spigen Slim Armor S which also has that feature and the two part design while having a thinner, rounded profile.", "tomorrow", "The case seems to be higher quality but the outside edges are sharp, especially the bottom where the power cord goes.  The sharp edges dig into my skin on my fingers and leave little marks.  Seems like I could cut my fingers if I move them the wrong way.  The cuts would be similar to paper cuts though.

It fits perfectly snug and I'm pleased with the way it has protected my phone so far.\nHowever, it's angled edges make the case quite uncomfortable to use. Around the front of the screen is a lip (that is to protect the screen from scratches when placing it face down, I'm assuming). I've had cases with a perimeter lip before, but none that come to a sharp angle around the whole thing. When I press the phone up against my ear to talk it actually stings a bit. Also, the cutouts for the speaker/charger/headphone ports on the bottom are equally sharp. If you are like me and use your phone with a pinky underneath it for balance, maybe you might be better off looking for something else.\nAnother slight complaint I have is the hole in the back for the Apple logo. I don't know why a &#34;Heavy Duty&#34; case has a hole right where an iPhone can get scratched easily (on the Apple logo). To protect it, I cut out s circular piece of an old iPhone 5 screen protector and put it on the back of my iPhone 6s.\nIn conclusion, this case looks nice, and offers pretty good protection- but simply isn't very user-friendly. I'll keep it for a while, but I plan on buying a less painful case in the future.", "great", "Accidentally slammed my iPhone in the crease of the trunk of the car; don't ask me how it happened but it did smh.

Good looking and easy install.", "Good and sturdy. Raised edges protect the face of the iPhone.  I would recommend this case.", "Good product", "Nice case", "Great case. Tough. Slick look. I like. I repeat, I like.", "Excellent product!", "This is a very nice case that is unjustly receiving negative reviews simply because people are clumsy.  The case is designed to MINIMIZE damage to your device. If you don't want your phone to break, stop dropping it... simple as that.\nSometimes, accidents happen and can't be prevented. That is when you hope the drop wasn't too major. However, some people are claiming they've had to have their phones repaired/replaced 2-3 times due to drops. These people should NOT have a modern-day, $600.00+ device. They should have the very first cell phone ever made... the one shaped like a giant brick.\nIf you are fortunate enough to own an iphone 6 or 6s, why not be extra mindful when you are handling it?  In the event of a REAL accidental drop, you will have a better chance of your phone surviving with this case on. Actually, you'll have a MUCH better chance of survival than without it. No case is guaranteed to protect every single drop. No case is built to be dropped repeatedly due to a careless owner either. &#60;/rant&#62;", "Great phone protector my roommate loves this case", "I have an iPhone 6 and needed a protective case to prevent further cracks on my screen.

It has been the best phone case I have ever utilized. This case came highly recommended from reviews and family who have purchased Spigen cases prior to my purchase.\nThe case is one of the cheapest ones that I could find that were still high quality. I am a broke college student, so the cheaper the better. Although it is lower in price, it still has high quality features and materials. In the past, I have been very rough on my phones and the cases on them. I have broken all my past phones by dropping them or being very bad to them. I have had Otter Boxes and other similar nice phone cases. They all have not protected my phone from my klutziness.  The Spigen Tough Armor is a totally different situation. It is super durable and shows little wear and tear. I have dropped my iPhone on numerous occasions and on all types of surfaces, it has yet to crack once while the Spigen Tough Armor case has been on. I give it a 5 out of 5 for protection and durability.\nA few of the things that drew me to the case were the color and overall look of the case. I have a gold iPhone and wanted to show off that feature of my phone. Spigen Tough Armor does not have tons of options on colors but I was drawn to the gold case. The gold Spigen case matches the gold in the phone perfectly. It makes my phone look very chic and classic. It also looks very professional and I am not ashamed of potential employers seeing my phone case.\nOverall, I highly recommend the Spigen Tough Armor phone case for the iPhone 6. It is classy looking, durable and does not break the bank. It is over all my favorite case that I have ever utilized for myself.", "Great and durable case !\nRecommended!!", "PErfect case", "Matches the gold color of the phone perfectly.

Just putting the card in normally split/cracked the hard case and now the case won't stand since the case cracked.  Poor quality.  Would not recommend and would not buy again.  Cheap and broke like a toy.", "Item met my expectations", "Great phone case for a man!", "Only have had my case for a few days and I love the sleek look. Its not very bulky and easy to hold. The only complaint is the edges could have been a little more curved. But for the price is a top of the line case and one I would recommend to anyone.", "The size is just right. The grip is firm. The edges protrude just enough to give a bit of protection.\nThe slot for the card to stand up the case [stand feature]...FAIL...major fail.\nThe slot does not really hold up most cards well. It works on some heavy duty cards like the black Marriott or Chase Saph Pref but normal cc or hotel keys will fall out.\nThe bottom of the slot is hard plastic and so frail that it actually cracked early on and won't hold anything at all now.\nWill not be buying this again and cannot recommend if you want a case that stands up without an arm.", "THIS is the iPhone 6 case I should have started with.  Instead I bought the cheaper Spigen model, dropped it on asphalt, and it cracked the glass in the bottom corner.  That wouldn't have happened with this case because it protects all 4 corners of the phone.", "Dropped my phone from various heights and had no problems. Never worried if the screen would crack if i dropped it from my work box truck. the only down side is that the phone's back gets very dirty from dirty build up inside the case.", "Offers no protection at all. Screen of my new iPhone 6 shattered on first drop. Absolutely disgusted!!", "Absolutely surprised at how effective it is and also pretty classy", "I'm very satisfied with this product. I wish I would have watched the video in the description because this case is described as HEAVY DUTY so I thought the would be a plastic layer covering the apple logo but most importantly the camera lens. Besides that little issue, this case looks great and it is not bulky at all.", "Nice for piece of mind. Gives you a much better grip on what can be a slick phone.", "Great case for me.  It is a handful, but protects my phone well up to this point.  Added the Maxboost glass screen protector.  They work well together.  Recommended.", "well designed and fairly priced.", "I have a spigen case for an iPhone 5s and like it quite a bit.  This one I find to have sharp edges that make a one handed grip on the phone uncomfortable.  It's not just the metal parts on the side, but especially at the bottom part of the case where to openings for the charger and the earphones go.  I would not purchase this again.", "Best iphone case I've owned to date. Very well built. It's comfortable, good looking, sleek and provides good protection for the phone.", "Strong case, perfect for anyone who is clumsy or prone to dropping their phone. No complaints.", "These phones are getting bigger and bigger.\nI like the cellphone pockets on pants and the larger iphone6 (small iphone6 but larger than the 5)\ndoesn't fit well in one pair of pants.\nThat being said, I like the smallest, streamlined case possible.\nIt's not the smallest case I've ever had and that is the only drawback.\nIt's definitely not huge, or even big actually.\nIt's a nice case and gets the job done, but I prefer something slimmer and more streamlined.\nGood case and I expect it to protect well.\nIt has so far.", "Great case for the price. Makes the 6 graspable.", "great fit, very durable.", "Nice looking phone case.  I'm surprised tat the metal hasn't scratched at all.  I think it will protect the phone well too.", "Nice case but you have to have a card on hand to use the standing feature, i was expecting it to be able to retract back into the case when not in use.", "Excellent quality it was a gift for my nephew :)", "I am very hard on my phone and drop it a lot!

I love it, makes my phone look nice.", "Great fit. Nice feel. Already took a hit on the corner.", "This case is bulky but it really protects my phone so I can't complain. I think it's great!", "Great case", "The case is nice, but the lock-in screen protector is useless. Save the $5 and buy the normal case without the screen protector or purchase a different screen protector.", "I've had this case for a about a month and I am speechless. This case meets all my expectations and is a really good part of my life. This case has a look good and does that job at the same time", "I got this case last year as soon as the IPhone 6 launched. Extremely good case, has protected my phone from just about anything. I really abuse my phone, I drop it about twice a day. Today I'm ordering a new one since after a year of abuse the case is all scratched up and damaged but my phone is perfectly fine. I've taking this case everywhere, Ive dropped this case down the Roman Colosseum stairs (If you been there you know those are some crazy big concrete dangerous stairs) overall great case, buying another one today.", "Best case ever, highly recommended to use this case with a screen protector", "Good product delivered on time", "cheap for an excellent quality product.

A great buy for the price.", "When I got this case I figured it would be short term. However I have been pleasantly surprised. It protects the phone on all side. I have dropped my phone several times since getting this case and no damage has been done to my phone. The only down side it that it adds a little bulk to the phone.", "I really like this case.  It slides in and out of my jeans pocket very easily and I don't think it added a lot of bulk to the phone (my Iphone 6 is already pretty big so a half inch or so doesn't really make that much of a difference to me).  I especially liked the color and look of the case.  The only thing I would have preferred would have been a storage slot for a credit card.  But I like it and use it every day.", "Works/fits great - fast shipping", "Very nice", "Best iPhone case I've ever owned and I've tried a lot of them. Offers great protection and I love the styling. I also bought the matching belt clip and it all works flawlessly together.", "very good product. sturdy, rugged looking, industrial. however, i prefer my iPhone 6 to be naked. So, i prefer my leather pouch by Snugg", "An amazing case! I have dropped my phone numerous of times and it hasn't cracked once!

This is my 2nd one.", "I had a Spigen case for my iPhone 5 that I loved so when I upgraded to a 6, I went looking for a similar case.  It's a different design, but just as good looking and protective. I like it.", "Excellent part", "The case itself is good; Sturdy and covers the edges. The screen protector on the other hand was a piece of crap, the adhesive was on the wrong side of the plastic.", "Great for work!  Extra protection is awesome but not too bulky. :)", "Protects the phone very well. Don't care much for the screen protector though.", "Great all around case.

Love the color.", "Love this brand & product", "I personally hate those bulky iPhone phone covers that you can barely put in a pocket, but this case not only is super sleek, it's also super sexy. I like the fact that it came in different colors which I got the gold case to match my phone. I've also dropped my phone on MANY occasions and had no accidents to date. I would mostly definitely recommend this case and I plan on getting the iPhone 6+ once I am eligible for an upgrade and will be getting this case to protect my next investment!", "I wanted to like this case because it's the same color of the phone.  It really isn't, it's more of a copper color.  Also, it may provide some protection but I wouldn't want to put it to the test because it seems pretty flimsy.", "I like the fit of this case. Style is also a plus. Only bad is that I ordered the grey one and got the gold one. Not going to worry about sending it back. Too much hassle just for a different color.", "Love how sterdy this case is and so classy looking. Love this case all in all and get so many compliments on it plus it protects my phone so well every time I drop it!", "The Spigen Tough Armor case is sleek, and when partnered with the Maxboost\u00ae iPhone 6 Glass Screen Protector, my phone seems well-protected.  It has sharp edges though and the Gunmetal finish is not the dark gray shade I thought it would be.  It has a bit of gold/copper tint to it. It doesn't feel slippery but the sharp edges make it a bit uncomfortable to hold.", "If you don't like big bulky cases this is the one to get!

It looks great on my phone and would recommend this to anyone that needs a great case.", "Great", "I bought a life proof case for my iPhone 6 that didn't last 6 months.

You'll be glad you did.", "perfect!", "This is my second Spigen case because they're awesome. I had one on my iPhone 5s and loved it, so I had to get another when I upgraded to the iPhone 6. My last case survived my accident that broke my shoulder when I flipped my bike on the freeway at 50mph. My bike was wrecked, my shoulder was broke, my helmet cracked, and I landed on my phone (the imprint was in my skin for 2 months following) but my phone survived thanks to the awesome case. It's sleek, smooth to the touch, and doesn't add a lot of bulk. The variety of colors are nice to choose from. I usually keep the same color, but it's nice to know that you can buy the other colors to mix and match. Overall, it gets the thumbs up from me.", "Looks great and fit perfectly! very satisfied.", "Has protected my iphone so far.  I've dropped it on concrete and grass.  I've done the 5 ft test on accident and it has done what it was designed to do so far.  You don't buy it for style for you do buy it for protection.  I wouldn't use my phone without it!", "Decent case.

Very disappointed in the durability of this product.", "I want to write a good review, but..... Everything is great but one thing, it has very sharp edges making it uncomfortable to hold for any length of time. I knew on the first day that I'll be shopping for another case.", "Slipery. I am returning because it can easily fall off my hand", "Great case for the price.", "One of best cases out there! The screen protector snaps into the case itself which keeps it tight with the screen so it does not impede use of screen as I have seen happen before with more expensive cases. Also, I accidentally damaged my screen and I emailed Spigen and after confirming that I had purchased this case they sent me a replacement part. Great customer service! I would recommend this case!", "So far so good. I like the tactical feel and although the surface isn't very 'grippy' as I was looking for, there are enough wedges to make it easy to hold. The protector just covers the front enough to fit a glass protector. The buttons feel solid.", "I love it!", "Good quality.", "It fit and it's perfect.", "Great case with great support with right dimensions and measurements.\nFour star because, back side of the case will catch your finger prints, you have to wipe it all the time.", "Will do phone case. Buttons are very hard to press. I recommend going  with a case with rubber outside and hard plastic.", "The back of the case seems fine, but the plastic cover held dirt next to the glass, and spotted the glass screen.  I haven't been able to remove the spots with water, alcohol, acetone, or mineral spirits.  My phone lived in my pant's pocket for 6 months.  My wife's lived uncovered in her purse for the same amount of time.  Her screen looks fine.", "my iPhone is secured with this case. good one.", "Love it!! Will buy again", "I had only rated this two stars but have since changed my rating. This case is so durable. I've dropped my phone so many times and it just bounces around like a baby in a cradle. My only complaint is that it's a bit slick. Can't go wrong with this and it's a great value.", "Not 24 hours after I put this case on my phone, I accidentally left my phone on the roof of my car after hunting and drove off down the highway. The phone in this case flew off the roof of the car and slammed into the pavement. When I realized what had happened and circled back around to pick up the pieces, I was shocked to find a fully working cell phone (although with a cracked screen) laying on the side of the road. I was able to pick it up and make a phone call right then and there. Needless to say, this case did its job quite well. I am ordering a replacement phone and buying this case again because it proved that it does its job.\nIn addition, I was pleased with the feel of the metal backing and the look of the gunmetal color. 5/5", "Great case-love it!", "Like the size...Good fit on the iPhone 6 (standard) a great and fun way to add a little extra color to the phone and protect your phone from small drops. the metal buttons are a nice touch. Time will tell how long the bumper lasts but, they are cheap enough to just re-purchase.", "Best rethenable price.", "This case fits the iPhone 6 perfectly. Bottom speaker, head phone jack, & lightning port are all open. Would have given 5 stars but the shut off button on the right side is very tight. You have to grip on both sides at the same time and usually raises the volume instead of shutting off the phone. It's a hard case & a little slippery.

It's slim and doesn't add the bulk. I paired it up with the Tech Armor screen protector because this case doesn't offer enough protection for the screen", "Nice case, but I ordered it in gold and got gun metal color instead.", "Provides good protection without adding a lot of bulk to the phone. Doesn't have a screen protector but my last phone lasted 4 years without one. So not a negative. You can always buy one.", "This case looks really good. No protection though.", "Excellent", "Great price", "The good:  Case seems protective\ngood looking design\nThe bad:  Each bend of the metal and plastic come to a sharp end.  Irritates my fingers and so had to return it.  Rounded edges would have made this a home run.\nCase makes phone a bit wide.  Fine for me, but for anyone with smaller hands might make it difficult to hold.", "Love it!", "Love this case! Great and sleek.", "I prefer this case over the OtterBox Defender. This is a great case. I haven't had any issues using the touch screen, fingerprint sensor or the volume buttons. I'm completely satisfied and highly recommend! I would recommend you also buy a screen protector like the ballistic glass by Tech Armor or Maxboost.", "I love this case!

Not to bulky and it looks really nice. The only thing that I wasn't too happy about was the color. I had ordered the champagne gold because I got the gold iPhone. On the case that is shown in the picture, it looks dead on gold just like the iPhone. That's why I liked it and ordered it. It came to me looking more gray then gold. I was expecting a vibrant gold like the one shown. /:", "Pretty good case.  It's not probably tough for every kind of drop but has held up to 4-6ft drops. Feels good.", "Fits great and works well.

No complaints.", "Sturdy cool-looking.", "Awesome!!!", "Great case, I like everything about it.", "Dropped my phone a few times and so far so good! Love this case, the color is awesome, it doesn't slide away when you quickly put it on a surface which is awesome, I know I had problems in the past with cases when I would quickly put my phone on the table only to watch it go flying off onto the floor. Haven't really used the cardstand feature, but I'm sure it will come in handy for upcoming airplane rides so I can watch movies :)", "Easy to install and great protection for my new phone.

Love it", "Shipping was fast and profit t was awesome thank you", "I like this case a lot.  It has protected my phone so many times.  It is slim and has an attractive simplistic design.  It feels like great quality and it has protection in all the right places.  I have thought about getting another case to add it to my collection and switch it up at times, but nothing compares.  I have recommended this case to others and I would totally buy it again.", "Great case", "Ordered it for my son and he loves it, he says its the best case hes ever had!", "This product is very cheaply made, not worth it at all, it is dollar store quality.", "not a bad case at all. Nice and thin, light yet protective. There's not much of a lip on the front, so a drop at the wrong angle could wreck your screen, but after multiple drops my phone is fine, screen remains unscratched (no screen protector), with no damage to the case.\nThe matte black finish provides a nice grip for the otherwise slippery (to me at least) iPhone 6. This is the only case I've ever kept on my phones - usually they stay on for a week before I get annoyed with them. I've pretty much always had a naked phone until this case. My only gripe is the opening in the back that shows the apple logo. It lets in dust and dirt, and has resulted in a circular area of fading on the back of my phone. But nothing's perfect, right?", "Great protection, and looks good too.\nMy daughter loves it on her phone...", "Very reliable. I've dropped my phone maybe seven different ways, and have yet to see a crack, scratch, or chip. Stylish and protective. Case gets the job done plus more.", "Great protection! Perfect.", "One of the best cell phone covers I've owned!", "Good quality!", "Good case friends have purchased after seeing mine", "This case has been a godsend for me at least. Being a somewhat clumsy person, i tend to drop my phone often, or at least more often than most. Have had no damage yet, it feels very sturdy, the buttons take a little getting used to, but become second nature. It does add a little girth, and a small amount of weight, but completely within a comfortable range. 5 stars through and through in my opinion.", "I Love this case for work!

I don't drop my phone often but, I definitely have a few times over the entire year and with this case I have incurred no dents or cracked screens.\nAlso, it hardly makes the phone bulkier AND it barely 'sticks to your pockets' when you try to pull it out.  This was a well designed case and well worth my purchase.", "This looks great but its just plastic. It costs almost the same as an otterbox so just go with that.", "Very nice quality for the price. I was surprised. Would suggest to others!", "It's durable but light. Just wish it had a screen protector.", "Looks great with my gold iPhone", "I love this case!

But I need a front cover to have full protection..", "I like the overall appearence of the case. Looks good and feels good in your hand. Does not feel bulky at all. And the plastic covering does not slip like the otterbox traveler case that I had. One you put the case on, its really hard to remove the plastic covering. You gotta really pry it open. And so, I have to remove the entire case as one piece if I have to take the phone out of it.\nAlso, the main complaint is, the headphone jack is not wide enough on the sides for a regular jack to fit in. I had to take my swiss army knife and carve it out until I could get the jack to sit in without popping out.\nIts 3 1/2 stars and since that is not an option, I gave it 3 stars.", "very good product", "Okay so I tend to be a little clumsy with my things and after I shattered the screen on my last phone by dropping it in a parking lot I figured getting a heavier phone case would probably help. I've had the case for about a month and it's held up really well. Even after dropping it a couple times the phone is intact and the case only has a few very small scratches. The only thing I don't like about this case is that I can't use my charging dock because the case is thick at the bottom. But I expected that so no biggie.", "Awesome", "The Best Case for Iphone 6", "This may be a case that does a great job protecting your phone, but it will kill your hands when you're holding it. The edges are really harsh. Anyone who has had an iPhone form the 4 through to the 5S knows the phone itself has hard edges. But cases I'd had all had rounded corners still.

Minus one star because i feel the edges could extend a little further up to protect against facedown-type drops.", "this case was wayyyy to bulky for my tastes. I really like the size of the new phone, but adding a case to it makes it unwieldy and almost impossible to hold with one hand. While it's great to have protection, I simply don't like the way it feels! I found \nthis great iPhone case\n that offers the thinnest protection on the market. It feels like a liquid skin, like I'm almost holding nothing at all, but still protects my phone from dirt and scratches. I'd highly recommend trying it - perhaps have two cases if you really have circumstances when you need a heavy-duty case, but the slim case for everyday use.", "My husband dropped his phone and shattered the face. So after having to burn 130 bucks to get it fixed, he finally agreed to get a cover.  This cover isn't anything special but it works!

It did increase the weight and size of my sleek iphone 6, but that's okay.  The champagne color on the back matches exactly the back of my phone.  Very pretty.  I overlook the bulky edges.", "Nope, doesn't protect the screen.", "Coming from the SGS3 one thing I was surprised when I first took out the SGS5 is the back cover is not a glossy plastic finish but a faux leather like on the iphone  which grips amazingly in my hand.\nI don't know if say the dotted pattern and the solid color version has a difference in grip, but putting on this case though reduces the grip of the phone with it's outer plastic shell which I think can become an issue with more accidental drops than without using the case. Even holding the phone with the glass to my palm grips better than the outer plastic shell.\nSpigen, if you are reading our reviews. Will there be grippy version of the outer shell? An example is the Incipio DualPro cases where the hard outer shell is rubberized but the downside to that case is the silicone layer which on my SGS3, made removing and putting the phone in my pants pocket harder than it should.\nPros:\n-Rigid TPU inner layer that doesn't attract lint and dust like silicone versions.\n-Lips and raised feet on the front and rear of the case.\n-Fits tight around the phone.\nCons:\n-Flush buttons makes it harder to find and press without looking. This can be fixed eventually with spending more time with the phone and case.\n-Plastic outer shell makes the phone more slippery than just the phone alone! This is will probably be the factor for people who are looking for a case. The faux leather cover Samsung has is amazing. It would be great to have this reproduced for the hard outer shell or just have some rubberized layer coated on top.", "really nice", "I ordered this heavy duty IPhone 6 case for my husband.  I feel sorry for his cell phone.  It gets dropped, dumped in glasses of iced tea, falls into the toilet, gets sat on and I'm sure many destructive adventures.  The day I ordered this was the day he said he was going to get a new IPhone 6.  I knew I had to gift him with a case that would protect his phone as much as possible.  This case is a simple design (which he loves) and it seems to be very durable and just what he needed.", "fast with shipping, Great case. Looks and feels really good", "Great product, very reliable and sturdy and it arrived quickly.", "Okay", "The plastic cover for the front doesn't fit well at all and moves up and down, and comes off easily.  They should make it so it fits much tighter and basically sticks to the surface of the phone. Very disappointed although good in concept", "Awesome case. People see it and think of how much cooler it looks then the average iPhone case. The champion looks flawless.", "Excellent", "Good strong bulky stylish", "Excellent case when combined with a glass screen protector. Case is well made and easily installed on the iPhone 6.", "The case is awesome. Stylish and covers my phone from getting scratches", "Nice case and the stand feature is cool. But it's the third iPhone6 case I've tried that DOESN'T FIT IN A DOCK. Can anybody recommend a decent case that allows the infernal &#34;lightning&#34; connecter to make contact in a dock???", "Already protected phone", "Had to stop using this because people could not hear me when I talked with the phone on the left side of my face.", "perfectly covers iphone 6", "This case came quick and was easy to install and looks and feels great"]
